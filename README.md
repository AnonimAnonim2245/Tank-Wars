# Tank Wars - Homework 1 (Computer Graphics Elements) - Luca Plian 332CA
## Overview

**Tank Wars** is a two-player 2D tank battle game developed using **C++** and **OpenGL**. The game features dynamic terrain, physics-based projectile movement, and strategic power-ups. Players control tanks that navigate a deformable landscape, aiming to eliminate the opponent by reducing their health to zero.

## Game Objective

In **Tank Wars**, each player controls a tank on a dynamically generated terrain. The primary objective is to strategically maneuver the tank, aim the turret, and fire projectiles to defeat the opponent. The game ends when a tank's health is reduced to zero.

## Features

### **Two-Player Mode**
- Each player has independent controls, enabling simultaneous gameplay.
- Real-time tank movement, aiming, and firing mechanics.

### **Dynamic Terrain**
- Terrain is generated using a mathematical function with added randomness.
- The terrain can be deformed by projectile impacts, affecting movement strategies.

### **Projectile Physics**
- Realistic projectile trajectories influenced by gravity.
- Adjustable turret angle for precise aiming.

### **Power-Ups**
- Five unique power-ups that modify gameplay, such as invincibility, speed boost, and health restoration.

### **Health & Invincibility System**
- Tanks start with 100 health points.
- Temporary invincibility available through specific power-ups.
